## re:Unlock All, a little QOL mod for Balatro.

Problem: Clicking "Unlock All" discovers and unlocks everything that currently exists, then disables the button. Things that are added later are not unlocked, and cannot be unlocked due to the button being gone.  
Solution: If anything exists which isn't discovered and unlocked, the button comes back.
